# Vapour-OS
What is Vapour OS?
Vapour OS is an Arch Linux based distro. It aims to be flexible, optimised for performance and security, used for a variety of purposes and with no extra junk. At its core, Vapour OS is a basic Arch Linux system with all the core packages, plus commonly used command line utilities and performance enhancements. I've also included features from other distros like Ubuntu, Steam OS and Android. Arch Linux follows a rolling release model, so you will always get the latest software updates, but Vapour OS additionally ships with it's own updater to install and configure new features.

Who is Vapour OS for?
Once the core system is installed, you can install and configure any extra software you need with a simple tool. Here are the current software choices:
Desktop/GUI: KDE Plasma, XFCE, Kodi and Steam Big Picture
Gaming: Proton/Wine, game libs (64bit and 32bit), emulators
Multimedia: Video codecs
Server: Nginx (with extra security features)
Security: Extra security features. Choose from enhanced (slight performance impact) and ultra-secure (bigger performance impact, for governments and cyber criminals)

Why the name?
I don't really know. I originally planned to make it a gaming distro, like Steam OS, so I changed Steam OS to Vapour OS.
